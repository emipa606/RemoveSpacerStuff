Rewrite of DarthBoers mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1753102445
	
- Rewrote the whole mod to C# instead
- Shield belts are Industrial tech so they will not get removed
- Added options to remove spacer items, research, factions and pawnkinds
- Based heavily on the mod Lord of the Rims - The Third Age

Do you ever wish Rimworld had more of a realistic setting? I use this with Combat Extended, More Traders, and a bunch of other mods and it seems to work fine. Grab this and a mod that disables Mechanoids and Infestations and you'll have a grand ol' time. Kind of. Just try to ignore all the log spam. 

Disables Marine armor, [strike]Shield Belts[/strike], Charge rifles, the Doomsday launcher and Triple rocket launcher. They won't spawn on raiders, traders, or potaters. Or anywhere else.


Uses Harmony.


TO ANY EXPERIENCED MODDERS:

I have very little, if any, idea how to C# and therefore this is based heavily on reverse engineering. If anyone knows how to make it stop log spamming, I'd appreciate it. I suspect that it has to do with other mods (Mainly Combat Extended) looking for the missing defs. I have no idea how to fix this.
