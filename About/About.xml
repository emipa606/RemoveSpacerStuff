- Rewrote the whole mod to C# instead
- Added options to remove spacer items, research, factions and pawnkinds
- Based heavily on the mod Lord of the Rims - The Third Age
	
--- Original Description ---
Do you ever wish Rimworld had more of a realistic setting? I use this with Combat Extended, More Traders, and a bunch of other mods and it seems to work fine. Grab this and a mod that disables Mechanoids and Infestations and you'll have a grand ol' time. Kind of. Just try to ignore all the log spam.

Disables Marine armor, Shield Belts, Charge rifles, the Doomsday launcher and Triple rocket launcher. They won't spawn on raiders, traders, or potaters. Or anywhere else.
